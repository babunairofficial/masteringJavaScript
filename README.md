# Mastering JavaScript

Welcome to **Mastering JavaScript** — a curated, evolving repository focused on revisiting, strengthening, and deepening my understanding of JavaScript.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **living knowledge base** for JavaScript, covering everything from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

Over time, this repository will include:

- Clear explanations of JavaScript concepts  
- Personal notes and insights  
- Code examples and experiments  
- Practice problems and challenges  
- Mini-projects  
- Advanced patterns, internals, and best practices  

This is **not a finished product**, but an evolving one — reflecting continuous learning and refinement.

## Who Is This For?

- Beginners starting their JavaScript journey  
- Developers revisiting fundamentals with deeper clarity  
- Learners who believe in **learning by building and revising**  
- Anyone interested in how JavaScript works under the hood

## Lesson 01: Variables in JavaScript

### Environment Setup
To begin working with JavaScript locally, **Node.js** was installed. This allows JavaScript code to be executed outside the browser and sets up the foundation for all upcoming lessons in this repository.

### What This Lesson Focuses On

This lesson revisits the fundamentals of **variable declaration in JavaScript** and clarifies how different keywords behave.

Concepts covered include:

- `const` for values that should not be reassigned  
- `let` for block-scoped variables  
- `var` and why it is generally discouraged  
- Declaring variables without any keyword  
- Understanding `undefined` for uninitialized variables  

---

### Key Takeaways

- `const` prevents reassignment and should be the default choice when values are not expected to change.
- `let` allows reassignment and respects block scope, making it safer and more predictable than `var`.
- `var` is function-scoped and can introduce subtle bugs due to scope leakage.
- Declaring a variable without a keyword implicitly creates a global variable, which is not recommended.
- Variables declared without an initial value are assigned `undefined` by default.
